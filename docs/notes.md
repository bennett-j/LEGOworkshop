- Laptop should be on and VS code running, but not essential.
- Ensure the hello world script is on the robot.
- Best to turn the robot on before but not essential.

- pybricks-stubs for intellisense

- the robot needs to be on (green light) to connect from vscode

- the robot will spit out an error log that can be uploaded to the pc (from the robot) and viewed in a text editor

- derivative didn't seem to be that useful when I briefly tried it

```
from pybricks.tools import wait
```
also robot.stop() both useful in moving the robot around

- taken the approach of not explaining too much of the code in the instruction sheet, believing that is better done by a demonstrator face to face.


# Ideas
- control the forward speed (faster when lower error?)
